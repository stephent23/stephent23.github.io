## About Infosecuriosity
Infosecuriosity has been set up as a repository for the research and content that I am curating. It is, at least initially, a bit of a brain dump and thus does (or may) encompass technical, non-technical, theoretical and practical posts.

My goal is to post content that others may find interesting and will hopefully provide some benefit to the wider security community. 

<br />

## My Background
I am currently working as a Security Operations Manager, leading a team that is responsible for delivering Security Monitoring, Incident Response, Forensics and Threat Intelligence services. 

Security Operations ("the SOC") and SOC analysts tend to be seen as junior security professionals and it is often the place where aspiring professionals will start in the industry. Although, the SOC is a great place to start a career in Security, I also believe that it is one of the most challenging areas too and should not be viewed as *just* the starting point, it can be the journey and the destination too. 

The SOC is absolutely somewhere that individuals are able to build a long, challenging and successful career. The threat landscape is constantly evolving and as a result, we are presented with new challenges to overcome in order to continue to be effective. To be successful, I believe we have to focus on people, ensuring that analysts in Security Operations have the time to develop skills, build their careers and in turn build comprehensive and effective security monitoring, incident response and forensics capabilities, all of which should be driven by threat intelligence. 

### How did I get here?
Good question. Honestly, it was by accident. I studied Computing at the University of Kent, as part of that I did a year working in industry. I applied to various organisations and happened to be offered a role in the Security team at a multi-national pharmaceutical company. That was where I found my passion for Cyber and Information Security and I haven't looked back since. Since graduating, I have continued to work for different organisations mainly focusing on Security Operations and spent some time specialising in Insider Threat and OT/ICS security too. 

I have recently completed two years part-time study for a Masters degree (MSc.) in Information Security from Royal Holloway, University of London. Part of this required me to submit an extensive research project titled: "How Human Behavioural-based Risks to Information Security May Change Through the Adoption of Modern Workplace Practices and Technologies".

## STEM & Education
I am also passionate about education and ensuring that young people are provided with opportunities and inspired to achieve the best that can. It is for this reason that I volunteered to be a <a href="https://www.stem.org.uk/stem-ambassadors">STEM Ambassador</a> which provides me with the opportunity to be able to give talks and support mentoring schemes with the aim of inspiring young people to pursue careers in STEM; more specifically providing them with some insight as to the opportunities that are available within IT and specifically Information & Cyber Security. I am also a governor at a local school.
