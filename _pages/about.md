I am a cybersecurity leader with over a decade of hands-on experience in Security Operations, Incident Response, and Digital Forensics. My work spans multiple critical sectors including Finance, Pharmaceuticals, and Critical National Infrastructure (CNI).

I specialise in identifying, containing, and remediating cyber threats, and have built and led high-performing teams in high-pressure environments. My approach is rooted in technical rigor, practical experience, and a deep understanding of both adversarial tactics and business risk.

# About Infosecuriosity
Infosecuriosity is a personal space Iâ€™ve created to collect and share the research, insights, and commentary that emerge from my day-to-day work and ongoing curiosity in cybersecurity.

Initially, this will be something of a working repository - a mix of the technical and non-technical, the theoretical and the applied. Over time, I hope it becomes a useful resource not only for me but for others working in or exploring the field.

My goal is to contribute to the broader security community by sharing content that informs, challenges, or simply sparks new ideas.
